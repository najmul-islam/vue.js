# Vue.js Learning Repository

Welcome to my personal learning repository for Vue.js! This repository contains the code and notes from my journey learning Vue.js, a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.

## Introduction

This repository documents my learning process with Vue.js. You'll find various projects and examples that I created while exploring the framework. The goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for myself and others who want to learn Vue.js.

## Branches for Learning Tutorials

I have created multiple branches in this repository, each dedicated to a different Vue.js tutorial. You can switch between these branches to explore the code and concepts covered in each tutorial. Here are the branches and their descriptions:

- **main**: The main branch contains general notes and resources.
- **geeky-shows**: [Vue.js for beginner](https://github.com/najmul-islam/vue.js/tree/geeky-shows) - Basic Vue.js concepts and setup.
